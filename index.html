                                        Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, refers to the
                                        buying and selling of goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of
                                        money and data to execute these transactions. Ecommerce is often used to refer
                                        to the sale of physical products online, but it can also describe any kind of
                                        commercial transaction that is facilitated through the internet. Ecommerce has
                                        evolved to make products easier to discover and purchase through online
                                        retailers and marketplaces. Independent freelancers, small businesses, and large
                                        corporations have all benefited from ecommerce, which enables them to sell their
                                        goods and services at a scale that was not possible with traditional offline
                                        retail.
